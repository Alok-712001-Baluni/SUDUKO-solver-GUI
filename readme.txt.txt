I have solved this problem using backtracking. 
Press space to watch the algorithm solving the problem step by step.
If you're solving this problem manually then you can't backtrack. 
So you have to insert the right value at the selected position. 
By definition, all valid Suduko puzzles should have only one solution.   

This directory contains two files:
1. GUI.py
2. solver.py

To run the game simply run the GUI.py file from IDE or the command line.
